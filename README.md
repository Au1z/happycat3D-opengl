# happycat3D-opengl

Happy Cat is a short 3D platformer game about a muscular little cat who dreams of proving himself.
As part of his training, he must overcome a series of challenging obstacles crafted by third-year engineering students.
Your goal is to guide Happy Cat across platforms, avoid falling, and reach the end while enjoying smooth animation, physics, and collision detection all powered by modern OpenGL.
